# library

Using HTML/CSS and JS files set up an interactive library web page.

## Details

* all book objects are stored in array


## To Do

* Add function to script (not the constructor) that can take user's input and store the book objects into an array

* Write function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page.

    * examples: some sort of table, each own "card"
    * manually add some books to see the display

* Add "NEW BOOK" button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book:
    * author, title, number of pages, whether it's been read, anything else

* Add a button on each book's display to remove the book from the library
    * Need to associate DOM elements with the actual book objects in some way

* Add button on each book's display to change its read status
    * Function that toggles a book's read status on your Book prototype instance
